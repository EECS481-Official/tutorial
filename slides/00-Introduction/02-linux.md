The Ubuntu 14.04 operating system has a built in screen reader called Orca Screen Reader. Here are some basic commands to get you started:
	* <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>super</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd> toggles Orca screen reader on/off
	* <kbd>insert</kbd> + <kbd>h</kbd> brings up the Orca screen reader documentation
	* <kbd>insert</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> opens a window to configure Orca screen reader

Note that the <kbd>super</kbd> is also known as the <kbd>Windows</kbd> key

Other accessibility options are available in Ubuntu such as Slow keys, Bounce keys, universal zoom functions, an on-screen keyboard, and several others.

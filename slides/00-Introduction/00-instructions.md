Welcome to the Teach Access Tutorial! This resource is part of the Teach Access Initiative, and provides best practices for making accessible mobile and web apps. This tutorial currently provides basic training for developers and designers, with more disciplines to come! If you are new to accessibility, you've come to the right place - the following material will help you get a solid footing on accessibility via hands-on exercises and useful reference guides. Follow the instructions below for using and interacting with the tutorial.

1. You can use the left and right arrow keys to navigate through the slides.

2. Each slide has some core concepts, code samples, and one or more exercises. After you complete an exercise,
use the verify button to check whether your solution is correct.

3. Instructions will be given throughout for VoiceOver - Appleâ€™s built-in screen reader, but there are some general instructions below for using NVDA, a popular free screen reader for Windows. 

Here are some instructions for navigating with VoiceOver:

    * <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd> turns VoiceOver on/off
    * <kbd>tab</kbd> navigates to an interactive element
    * <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>opt</kbd> + <kbd>right arrow</kbd> (repeatedly) 
    navigates to the next element
    * <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>opt</kbd> + <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>h</kbd> 
    (repeatedly) navigates by headings
    <br/><br/>

Here are some instructions for navigating with NVDA:

	* <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd> turns NVDA on
    * <kbd>tab</kbd> navigates to the next focusable element
    * <kbd>down arrow</kbd> navigates to the next element and <kbd>enter</kbd> selects
	* <kbd>insert</kbd> + <kbd><F7></kbd> opens a list of all elements for quick navigation via <kbd>up arrow</kbd> and <kbd>down arrow</kbd> 
    * <kbd>H</kbd> navigates by headings
	* for a full list of commands, see section 4.5 of the official NVDA documentation <a href="http://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/userGuide.html#toc26">at this link<a>
    <br/><br/>

4. When verifying with VoiceOver, use Chrome on a Mac for the best experience. When verifying with NVDA, use firefox for the best experience. However, the "Verify" button provided after each exercise will work with any browser/OS combination.

5. ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications, a W3C standard for 
   building accessible user interfaces on the web.

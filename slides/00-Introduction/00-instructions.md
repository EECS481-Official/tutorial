Welcome to the Teach Access Tutorial! This resource is part of the Teach Access Initiative, and provides best practices for making accessible mobile and web apps. This tutorial currently provides basic training for developers and designers, with more disciplines to come! If you are new to accessibility, you've come to the right place - the following material will help you get a solid footing on accessibility via hands-on exercises and useful reference guides. Follow the instructions below for using and interacting with the tutorial.

1. You can use the left and right arrow keys to navigate through the slides.

2. Each slide has some core concepts, code samples, and one or more exercises. After you complete an exercise,
use the verify button to check whether your solution is correct.

3. You can also verify the code sample output using VoiceOver - Apple's built-in screen reader (other screen readers work too). Here are some instructions for navigating with VoiceOver:
    * <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd> turns VoiceOver on/off
    * <kbd>tab</kbd> navigates to an interactive element
    * <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>opt</kbd> + <kbd>right arrow</kbd> (repeatedly) 
    navigates to the next element
    * <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>opt</kbd> + <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>h</kbd> 
    (repeatedly) navigates by headings
    <br/><br/>
 On Windows, the equivalent is Narrator, but it only works with Internet Explorer or MS Edge for text that is not in the tab sequence. Here are some instructions for navigating with Narrator:
 	* <kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd> turns Narrator on/off. Narrator can also be opened from the sign-in screen, from the ease of access button, or the ease of access setting from the settings app.
 	* <kbd>Caps lock</kbd> + <kbd>F1</kbd> shows a list of all narrator commands, or on touch screens, tap 3 times with 4 fingers.
 	*"Views" change how Narrator navigates apps and webpages. Items is the default view, which can be a button, a link, or text. Other views include characters, words, lines, paragraphs, headings, and landmarks. Change views with <kbd>Caps lock</kbd> + up/down, and navigate with <kbd>Caps lock</kbd> + left/right. Press <kbd>Caps lock</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd> to activate an item.
 	* <kbd>Caps lock</kbd> + <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> turns Scan Mode on or off, which allows fast navigation of pages. In Scan Mode, the up and down arrows navigate by line, <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + left/right navigates by word, and <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + up/down navigates by paragraph.
 	

4. When verifying with VoiceOver, use Chrome on a Mac for the best experience. However, the "Verify" button provided after each exercise will work with any browser/OS combination. NB: the tables tutorial will require Safari on Mac for full functionality.
5. ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications, a W3C standard for 
   building accessible user interfaces on the web.

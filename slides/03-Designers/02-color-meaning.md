Color blindness is the inability or decreased ability to see color or perceive 
color differences. [Approximately 4.5% of the world's 
population](https://nei.nih.gov/health/color_blindness/facts_about) are color 
blind to some degree. In order to ensure that someone with color blindness can 
successfully use your product, you cannot rely completely on color alone to 
communicate information. By extension, using colors or patterns alone to 
indicate something will not be accessible to a blind users. In instances where 
you are using color as an indicator (for instance, green for something active 
and grey for something inactive), include a text equivalent description for the 
state.

Most colour blind people are able to see things as clearly as other people but they unable to fully ‘see’ red, green or blue light. There are different types of colour blindness and there are extremely rare cases where people are unable to see any colour at all.

The most common form of colour blindness is known as red/green colour blindness and most colour blind people suffer from this. Although known as red/green colour blindness this does not mean sufferers mix up red and green, it means they mix up all colours which have some red or green as part of the whole colour. For example, a red/green colour blind person will confuse a blue and a purple because they can’t ‘see’ the red element of the colour purple. See the example of pink, purple and blue pen cases below to understand this effect.

Here's an example where providing a very simple texture to a bar chart will aid in readability and understanding for someone with decreased color perception.
